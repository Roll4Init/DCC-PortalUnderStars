# DCC-PortalUnderStars

This is a python program that will create a character and run through the DCC module Portal Under the Stars.

## What is DCC?

DCC is better known as Dungeon Crawl Classics which is a role playing game (much like Dungeons and Dragons) but using a ruleset from an older version of D&D and simpler character builds. The core idea of DCC is your characters are not special they might die in the first battle or the next, so you shouldn't spend much time creating them. You typically start off with two or three new characters usually created at random and the character than survives the session becomes your main character. 

## Is this a classic RPG using the D20 system?

Yes, while DCC makes use of different dice (D30 for example) the majority of the rolls are completed using the classic seven dice as listed below. 

**DCC Dice Set**

```
D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D10, D%10, D12, D14, D16, D20, D24, D30
```

**Classic D20 Dice Set**
```
D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D%
```

## What is Portal Under the Stars?

Portal Under the Stars is a module in the DCC world which is published in both the Dungeon Crawl Classics Quickstart Rulebook and the larger Rulebook. The module is designed for a level 0 character and is typically very short to run, making it a great first adventure. 

## Why create this? 

Aside from creating a group programming project for learning, the DCC rules and tables create some intersting problems to work with. The rules creating the character stats make references to the rulebook and depend on the dice rolls. 

## Goals

Ideally this will first start off as a console script, then move to either a GUI app or maybe something in Bottle. The end result should be hosted on Heruko or Google App Engine where it's easily shared with others.
